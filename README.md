As a first step we try to obtain as many subdomains as possible (***onlydomain.sh***) and by using diferent tools, we run an analysis on each one separately (***reconandvulns.sh***).

To run these scripts, you must install the tools. The procedure to install the tools is on the ***tools.txt*** file.

It should be noted that the scripts are not linked, so the 2nd part must be executed manually.

I apologize for the code, but it's not my strong ðŸ˜•
